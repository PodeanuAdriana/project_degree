My bachelorâ€™s project focuses on developing a web application for trip planning, where I integrated multiple personal passions. The central theme was built on my love for travel and capturing breathtaking places through photography.

To create this application, I utilized technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for building the website and designing the user interface, including the admin interface. For database connectivity and site functionalities, I used the PHP programming language due to its ease of use and understanding.

The application is centered around creating simple and quick-to-fill forms. Based on the input provided, the results are filtered to showcase specific tourist destinations, attractions, restaurants, and accommodations.

A key advantage of this project is its ability to suggest travel destinations based on selected preferences by randomly generating location recommendations.
